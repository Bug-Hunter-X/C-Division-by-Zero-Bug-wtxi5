This repository demonstrates a common C programming error: division by zero. The file bug.c contains a simple program that attempts to divide an integer by zero, resulting in undefined behavior. The bugSolution.c file provides a corrected version of the program that includes a check to prevent division by zero. This example highlights the importance of input validation and error handling in C programming.
